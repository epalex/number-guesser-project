 Number Guesser, a Codecademy project

In this project, you’ll write four JavaScript functions in script.js to power a small guessing game. 
We’ve provided some additional JavaScript code in game.js 
that will call your functions based on user interactions, 
but you don’t need to look at game.js and shouldn’t edit it if you want your project to work as intended.

* rebuild html, css for practice
